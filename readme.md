 ## Instructions to Run the Trio Project

## Running the Backend

1. **Navigate to the Backend Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/nikhilsingh/Downloads/Trio/trio-Backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install the required packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the `trio-Backend` directory and add the following variables:
   ```plaintext
   DB_CONNECT=<your_mongodb_connection_string>
   JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret>
   GOOGLE_MAPS_API=<your_google_maps_api_key>
   PORT=3000
   ```

   Replace `<your_mongodb_connection_string>`, `<your_jwt_secret>`, and `<your_google_maps_api_key>` with your actual values.

4. **Start the Server**:
   Run the following command to start the backend server:
   ```bash
