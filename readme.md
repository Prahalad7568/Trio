# üöñ Trio - Ride Sharing Application

## üìå Overview

The Trio project is a comprehensive ride-hailing application built using a microservices architecture. It consists of three main services: **User Service**, **Captain Service**, and **Ride Service**, along with a **Gateway** that acts as a reverse proxy to route requests to the appropriate service. The frontend is developed using **React** and **Vite**, providing a responsive and interactive user experience.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Microservices

1. **User Service**:
   - Manages user registration, login, and profile management.
   - Handles user authentication and authorization using JWT.
   - Interacts with a MongoDB database to store user data.

2. **Captain Service**:
   - Manages captain registration, login, and profile management.
   - Handles ride requests and availability status.
   - Uses JWT for authentication and maintains a blacklist of tokens for security.

3. **Ride Service**:
   - Manages ride creation, acceptance, and completion.
   - Calculates fares based on pickup and destination.
   - Uses RabbitMQ for real-time communication between services, allowing captains to receive ride requests.

4. **Gateway**:
   - Acts as a single entry point for all client requests.
   - Routes requests to the appropriate microservice based on the URL path.
   - Provides a layer of security and load balancing.

### Frontend

- Built using **React** and **Vite**, the frontend provides a seamless user experience with features such as:
  - User and captain registration and login forms.
  - Real-time ride tracking and notifications.
  - Interactive maps for pickup and destination selection.
  - Responsive design for mobile and desktop users.
